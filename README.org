#+title: Let's Go

https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/

Project structure loosely based on:

- https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016
- https://github.com/thockin/go-build-template

Important things so far:

- Handlers are receiver functions of the `application` struct
- Routes are receiver functions of the `application` struct
- Snippets are receiver functions of the `SnippetModel` struct
  - This essentially means that the DB connection is shared between all the query functions
