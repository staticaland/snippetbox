Code for the [[https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/][Let's Go book by Alex Edwards]].

Project structure loosely based on:

- [[https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016][Peter Bourgon - Go best practices, six years in]]
- [[https://github.com/thockin/go-build-template][thockin/go-build-template]]

Important things so far:

- Handlers are receiver functions of the =application= struct
- Routes are receiver functions of the =application= struct
- Snippets are receiver functions of the =SnippetModel= struct
  - This essentially means that the DB connection is shared between all the query functions
